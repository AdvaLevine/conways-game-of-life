# Conway's Game of Life - Implementation Reflection

## Tool Used
- **Name of the tool**: Claude 3.7 sonnet AI in Cursor IDE
- **Why selected**: Claude offers advanced capabilities for code generation and explanation, and Cursor IDE provides an integrated environment for coding assistance, during our classes we've used cursor hence i'm the most comfortable using it to complete this task.

## Repository Link

## Prompting Strategy

### Effective Prompts

1. **Development Plan Creation**:
   ```
   Create a structured development plan for implementing Conway's Game of Life using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript following the MVC pattern.
   ```
   This prompt worked well because it established a clear roadmap with distinct stages, helping to organize the implementation process.

2. **MVC Implementation**:
   ```
   Implement the core Game of Life logic following an MVC pattern with separate model.js, view.js, and controller.js files.
   ```
   This was effective because it created a clean separation of concerns, making the code more maintainable and easier to extend.

3. **UI Enhancement**:
   ```
   Add dark/light theme support, and visual feedback for cell state changes, adding advanced settings options to import and export patterns.
   ```
   This prompt successfully improved the user experience with modern UI features while maintaining the existing functionality.

### Problematic Prompts

1. **Speed slider adjusments**:
   ```
   The slider for the speed doesnt go all the way to the right and all the way to the left, how can I fix this?
   ```
   The prompt wasn't clear enough, not informative, and the AI didn't understand what was the problem until I clearified that I wanted the slider to work like a regular slider and to get all the way to the left if it's 0 speed and all the way to the right if it's 10 speed.


## Tool Evaluation

### Strengths
- Excellent at generating structured, well-commented code, readable 
- Consistent implementation of design patterns as requested (MVC)
- Good at creating responsive and accessible UI components with a nice interface
- Effective at suggesting performance optimizations (like using requestAnimationFrame to enhance user engagement)

### Weaknesses
- Sometimes generated overly complex solutions for simple problems
- Occasional inconsistencies in styling approaches, put some components on top of one another
- Limited understanding of performance implications for large grid sizes, had to fix the code multiple times myself
- Generated code sometimes required manual adjustments

### Most Helpful Areas
- Initial project structure setup, dividing into three different files to make use of the MVC pattern
- Implementation of core game logic 
- Creation of the pattern library
- UI design and implementation

### Limitations
- Debugging complex timing issues with animation frames
- Optimization for very large grid sizes was a bit problematic I had to step in manually and adjust 

### How many iterations
The project went through approximately 20 major iterations from initial concept to final implementation, with key refinement phases focused on:

1. Core game logic implementation
2. UI design 
3. Pattern library expansion
4. Performance optimization (using requestAnimationFrame)
5. Save/restore functionality
6. Advacned Controls - export/import patterns

Each iteration improved the quality and features, fixing bugs while maintaining the clean MVC architecture established at the beginning. 

## Code Quality

### Manual Improvements
- Optimized the grid rendering for large grid size by manually changing the code and logic to suit the larger screen
- Refined save/load functionality with more robust error handling
- Fixed the speed slider to run smoothly 
- Added the dark mode theme and applied it to all components and labels 
- Rearranged some components in UI 

### MVC Pattern Implementation
The codebase follows the MVC pattern like so:

- **Model** (model.js): Handles all game state, rules logic, and data management
- **View** (view.js): Manages rendering to DOM and UI updates without direct knowledge of game rules
- **Controller** (controller.js): Connects user interactions to model operations and updates the view

This separation allowed for independent development and testing of each component, making the code more maintainable and readable.

### Code Structure Observations
- Strong modularity with clear separation of concerns
- Consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase as expected
- Effective use of ES6 classes for organizing related functionality (Pattern Manager etc.)
- Well-documented functions with clear purpose and parameters, clean code
- Good event handling architecture that's easy to extend (scalable)
